## Intro

This is a monorepo forked from [NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo) to consolidate ESLint configs, made specifically for TypeScript and React projects. Feel free to fork them or use them directly â€” check out the [`packages`](packages) folder to see the configs.
